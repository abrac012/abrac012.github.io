                                <p>There are some thing about the functionality that I don&#39;t super like on this theme. So here are some quick thoughts on stuff to change and we&#39;ll see how I feel about those thoughts later</p>
                            </header>
                            
                            <div class="image main"><img src="/images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></div>
                            
                            <p>Okay, so here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip;
I think the header is kind of unnecessary because of the nav bar. So I think for the desktop site it actually makes more sense not to have a header. So the scroll down arrow should direct down to #nav instead of the header. I&rsquo;d have to change the scss file as well, I think so that the nav section has a better &ldquo;break&rdquo; between the top of the page and the actual nav bar. Then on the mobile site it does make sense to have a header, because there you have to rely on the menu to navigate, so having a quick shortcut to the homepage would actually be a helpful functionality there.</p>
<p>Also as far as making a dark theme option, I think the background is already fine for that, but the actual post content isn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know how to fix that yet, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some sort of color pallete I can reference so that things are still a nice and easy color to use.</p>
<p>Those are all my thoughts so far. I&rsquo;ll edit this as my opinions evolve, but I think I need to take a break so that I can look at the site with fresh eyes when I return to it.</p>
