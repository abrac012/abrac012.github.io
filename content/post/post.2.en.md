Okay, so here's what I'm thinking...

As far as making a dark theme option, I think the background is already fine for that, but the actual post content isn't. I don't know how to fix that yet, but I'm sure there's some sort of color pallete I can reference so that things are still a nice and easy color to use.

Those are all my thoughts so far. I'll edit this as my opinions evolve, but I think I need to take a break so that I can look at the site with fresh eyes when I return to it.

Anyway, as far as writing content goes, I've gotta figure something out here. I have to fill out my about me section and talk about what I do and why I'm cool and interesting and what not and talk a lil about my journey. Then I have a post I can make using my energy storage report. Speaking of which...
