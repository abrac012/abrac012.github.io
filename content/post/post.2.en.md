Okay, so here's what I'm thinking...
I think the header is kind of unnecessary because of the nav bar. So I think for the desktop site it actually makes more sense not to have a header. So the scroll down arrow should direct down to #nav instead of the header. I'd have to change the scss file as well, I think so that the nav section has a better "break" between the top of the page and the actual nav bar. Then on the mobile site it does make sense to have a header, because there you have to rely on the menu to navigate, so having a quick shortcut to the homepage would actually be a helpful functionality there.

Also as far as making a dark theme option, I think the background is already fine for that, but the actual post content isn't. I don't know how to fix that yet, but I'm sure there's some sort of color pallete I can reference so that things are still a nice and easy color to use.

Those are all my thoughts so far. I'll edit this as my opinions evolve, but I think I need to take a break so that I can look at the site with fresh eyes when I return to it.
