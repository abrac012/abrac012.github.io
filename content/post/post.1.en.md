Within a nuclear reactor's core, a series of highly energetic interactions are happening in quick succession. Neutrons fly, strike nuclei, and ignite an exothermic process that can deliver massive quantities of power at scale. This process, nuclear fission, is considered to be self-sustaining through a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Essentially, when a nucleus fissions, it doesn't split cleanly in half, making two different isotopes, or "fission products." These new isotopes, both the heavier and the lighter one, are generally pretty unstable. For many of these, the most likely path to stability lays in beta decay, wherein they can convert a neutron into a proton by emitting an electron and a tiny, mysterious particle called a neutrino. Through beta decay, the parent isotope becomes a new, ideally more stable daughter isotope. Notably, these fission products tend to be so unstable, they will usually emit a gamma ray (or a few) before undergoing beta decay as a further de-excitation measure.

*When a nucleus fissions, its fission products are often unstable and will beta decay, producing secondary/tertiary/etc. fission &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;products.*

Usually it takes a few tries-- on average, a primary fission product will undergo a chain of three beta decays. Some of these later fission products are also key to the larger nuclear reaction's functioning. Remember the neutrons flying around from earlier? Some of these neutrons are released as a part of fission themselves, called prompt neutrons. But some of them, arguably the most important, come from the beta decay chain. Every now and then, a fission product appears that can release a neutron *before* it beta decays. These delayed neutrons are the life blood of the nuclear chain reaction. They arrive just in time to propagate the reaction just as the prompt neutrons die down. Think of this as a helpful nudge when a domino doesn't immediately topple over in the chain. 

![img](/images/Prompt_and_Delayed_Neutrons.png "Prompt and Delayed Neutron Production")
*Fission produces neutrons as well as fission products. The prompt neutrons go on to produce more fission, but not enough to sustain the chain reaction. Fission products called neutron precursors produce delayed neutrons, which cover the gap necessary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to propel the chain reaction.*

In fact, these delayed neutrons are exactly why we are able to do controlled nuclear fission at all. Prompt neutrons arrive far too quickly (on the microsecond scale) for reactor controllers to stop them. However, delayed neutrons take longer, on the second scale. If too many neutrons were present in your core, you could get a runaway reaction. This is what we refer to as the core going super critical. Control rods in the core allow us to absorb some of the neutrons, controlling the neutron population. When a sharp increase in delayed neutrons occurs, a super critical reaction may begin. However, those seconds between one wave of delayed neutrons and the next allows for enough time to input control rods and slow the reaction, dampening the core's criticality and preventing a runaway reaction.

So anyone trying to build a nuclear reactor has a vested interest in knowing how often these neutron precursors occur. Knowing that greatly helps model the behavior of a reactor, aiding in determining necessary fuel amounts, as well as in modeling and mitigating risk scenarios. Additionally, it would be beneficial to know what percentage of fission products are *not* precursors, or even what percentage of fission products are "neutron poisons"-- isotopes that eat up neutrons and slow the fission process. So for any fission product, it is important to ask: after one fission, what is the probability that the fission product "X" is produced? The probability in this case is what we call the fission product yield (or FPY) of X! These FPYs depend on two key factors: the nuclear composition of the fuel isotope and the energy of the incident neutron.

Nuclear reactors generally use Uranium-235 for their nuclear fuel. However this is never 100% pure and often includes some percentage of Uranium-238, which is also capable of fission, but only when the incident neutron has a high energy. Instead, Uranium-238 can absorb low-energy neutrons and then decay towards Plutonium-239, which is more fissile than Uranium-235. As a nuclear reactor's fuel is used, the percentage of Plutonium-239 increases. So there are three typical isotopes of different composition in a reactor's fuel: U-235, U238, and Pu-239. On the other hand, the neutrons can be of theoretically any energy depending on various factors, but in reactors they are predominantly very low energy. These neutrons are vastly more likely to produce fission in U-235 and Pu-239, which make up the majority of the fuel in a reactor. Thus, it is paramount that FPYs be well known for the lowest neutron energies reasonably achievable in experiments. The figure below shows three examples of FPYs over a range of isotopes. The range of isotopes is identical in each, but the energy of the incident neutrons are not.

From left to right, these are FPYs from the fission of U-235 induced by neutrons at  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energies of 0.0253 eV, 500 keV, and 14 MeV.*

The figure above shows three examples of FPYs over a range of fission products. The range of products is identical in each, but the energy of the incident neutrons are not. These plots show that FPYs increase as incident neutron energies decrease, consistent with what we see in nuclear reactors. Better understanding of low energy neutron interactions with nuclear fuels is necessary to build safer, more efficient nuclear reactors.

## National Security and New Physics

I believe by now the importance of FPYs in nuclear energy may be clear. However, there is more motivation to study them. There's a character in this story that is often neglected in discussions of nuclear reactors: the neutrino.

The neutrino is a wonderfully mysterious particle. Almost massless, electrically neutral, it eluded physicists for a long time. Their elusiveness is perhaps their most important quality, as they are exclusively weakly interacting particles. As a natural byproduct of beta decay, though, any time there is fission, there will be neutrinos. In fact, for any given series of fissions there is a *spectrum* of neutrinos, examples of which are shown below. This spectrum is unique to the fissile isotope involved in the fission, U-235, U-238, and Pu-239 all produce different neutrino spectra. So these neutrino spectra can act as a signature of the fuels within a nuclear reactor. If there were 20% Plutonium-239 and 80% Uranium-235 in a reactor, the neutrino signature of this reactor would look like a weighted average of the Plutonium-239 and Uranium-235 spectra. This is a *big* deal. After all, neutrinos are weakly interacting and pass through basically all shielding completely unperturbed.

*Taken from Kim, Yeongduk. (2016). Detection of Antineutrinos for Reactor Monitoring, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.net.2016.02.001. The left-hand figure shows the number of neutrinos normalized by the energy of the reactor vs the energy of the emitted neutrinos. The right-hand shows the neutrino spectrum seen by detectors. Conversion between the two types of spectra &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depends on known physical interaction properties between detectors and neutrinos.*

Nuclear reactors can be used as a tool for producing weapons-grade Plutonium. Conversely, they can also be used to decommission nuclear warheads. These two facts make it incredibly important that accurate reactor monitoring occur, particularly between nations that have nuclear nonproliferation treaties. It is necessary, then, to develop reactor monitoring protocols that are not easily deceived or where signals are not easily concealed. Neutrinos are uniquely equipped for the task as there is no way to shield them and no convenient way to easily produce them. Therefore, there is no way to disguise the neutrino signal coming from a nuclear reactor. Since the neutrino signature of a reactor is unique to the fuel composition, unhidable, and abundant, neutrino detection would serve as the ideal candidate for reactor monitoring and associated national security efforts. To achieve this, however, the neutrino signatures of nuclear fuels must be known extraordinarily well!

There are major scientific reasons for wanting to understand these spectra well, too. As I mentioned, neutrinos are mysterious. For one thing, they have already broken the standard model of particle physics. This model assumes that neutrinos are massless, like the light particles we call photons. And yet, they have mass! Efforts to better understand some of the peculiar behaviors of neutrinos (which I won't go into in this blog post) led to particle physics experiments in the 2010s at various nuclear reactors, since they are a convenient source of neutrinos. The results of these experiments depended significantly on the expected reactor neutrino spectra. The teams thus chose to be safe and measure the spectrum of their reactor directly and compare it to the theorized spectrum to verify there was nothing inconsistent between the two ahead of their experiments. What they found was surprising, it seemed that no matter what they did the experimental and the theoretical spectra did not seem to align. In fact, the experiments uncovered what is now known as "the bump." This bump was a deviation from the theoretical, where experimental results showed there were 10% more neutrinos than predicted at high energies.

![img](/images/RANA.png "The bump")
*Taken from Hayes, AC, Vogel P. (2016). Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 66:219-44. The two spectra above show separate experimental measurements of reactor neutrino spectra from two different reactors. In the lower portion of each figure is a ratio (or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differential ratio in the right-hand's case) of experimental to theoretical. Both experiments show the presence of the bump.* 

This completely challenged the existing theoretical framework for calculating these spectra and revealed that the original developers of this theory had miscalculated the probability of various fission products. It wasn't entirely their fault, the development of this framework relied on an extreme amount of calculations, and one way to condense the problem is to throw out exceedingly unlike interactions, such as extremely unlikely fission products beta decaying into other unlikely fission products. In doing so, they underestimated the probabilities of these occurrences, leading to the discrepancy. New methods of calculating this theoretical spectrum now rely on our now vastly improved computational power in combination with existing FPY data. However, any FPY values are themselves calculated from theory, not experiment, and in the cases of some key fission products, these values don't exist at all for the kinds of low-energy neutron induced fission that is so common in nuclear reactors.

In short, in order to better study neutrinos, experiments need a better theoretical understanding of neutrino spectra from nuclera reactors. Similarly, for reactor monitoring efforts, an in-depth understanding of these spectra is extraordinarily important. And of course, to build better, more efficient, safer, and more advanced reactors, we need better nuclear databases with the most accurate information possible. All of these depend on the same thing: improved, experimentally measured FPY data. This is where I come in.

## Solving the Problem

How do we measure FPYs then? Well, we take nuclear fuels, and make them fission!

The traditional way to do this is exceptionally slow. It involves taking milligrams of fissile materials, let's say U-235 for simplicity, then firing a low-energy neutron beam at it to induce fission. Then, experimenters wait a long time, long enough that the excessive nuclear radiation fades, so that the U-235 sample can be safely handled and moved in front of a gamma-ray detector. To avoid exposure to destructive neutron radiation, gamma-ray detectors cannot be in the same room as the neutron beam. Transportation is thus not only necessary, but extraordinarily slow, resulting in the loss of all of the short-lived fission products (seconds to minutes). These tend to be the most unstable, so they cause most of the hefty radiation. They are also more likely to be isotopes that have FPYs calculated solely from theoretical approximations, not from data.

So we developed a solution. A RApid, Belt-drIven, Target Transport System, or RABITTS (it's a stretch, I know). This is essentially an extremely precise and fast conveyor belt to which we can attach our fissile material holster. We then opened a hole in the shielding that divides two rooms at our accelerator, through which the holster can be transported while still minimizing neutron exposure in the detectors. This allows us to irradiate a target and transfer it to our detectors in just barely over 1 second.

![img](/images/Rabbits_Scheme.png "The RABITT System")

*A schematic of our experimental set up. The RABITT track allows us to transport fissile targets from the irradiation position to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the counting position in 1.06 seconds.*

Our gamma-ray detectors are then able to show us exactly how much of each fission product there is in our sample after irradiation. When fission products appear, prior to beta decaying, they tend to emit gamma rays as a means of offloading a lot of instability very quickly. These gamma rays are conveniently unique! They depend entirely on the nuclear structure of the isotope, and since no two isotopes have the exact same nuclear structure, no two isotopes emit the exact same energy in their gamma rays (most of the time, anyway). These gamma ray energies then function as a convenient barcode, where each gamma ray of a particular energy corresponds to one specific isotope! If you count the amount of gamma rays at this energy, you are effectively counting the amount of that isotope produced!

![img](/images/Example_Gammas.png "Example Gamma Ray Spectra")
*Two gamma ray spectra from our detectors. The left-hand spectrum was collected using the traditional transportation method, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right-hand side utilized the RABITT system.*

Of course, the density of peaks and rapid decay times introduces new analytical challenges. My research focused first on collecting these novel data and is now geared towards developing new methods in the analysis frameworks for these kinds of spectral data. In the end, though, we are able to determine the amounts of different fission products produced, as well as the total amount of fissions undergone at our fissile materials. After some corrections for the efficiency of our detectors and some other nuclear processes, we can calculate FPYs easily, as they are effectively a ratio of the population of a particular fission product to the number of fissions that occurred. And in fact, we did this for several of the most important, least studied fission products out there.

## Conclusion

I won't elaborate on any results here yet, especially as I am putting together my thesis and working towards a formal publication of these results. I will say, however, that the experiments and measurements were a success, as were the novel analytical methods we designed for these new kinds of fission product data!

My primary interest here is in making my science more accessible to others! I think treating it simply is the best way to not get lost in the statistical noise of all of it. I do complex data analysis on complex nuclear data. But fundamentally that data and analysis tell a bigger story than just "using likelihood maximizing models to determine the quantities and temporal behavior of fission spectral data." They tell a complicated story about the different kinds of data that can come from similar scenarios (traditional versus fast-paced gamma-ray detection, in this case). They also tell of the importance of fundamental science! The new physics implications of these studies are fascinating and valid in their own right, but even more-so are the direct impacts of that fundamental science: better nuclear safety, more efficient nuclear power. Curiosity about what may seem like distant and abstract concepts like the intricacies of nuclear physics or the behaviors of the miniscule particles that shape our universe can lead to outcomes that are both satisfying intellectually and fundamentally beneficial to every day life!

But, if you skipped all the way down here for a TL;DR, here it is:

Fission product yields are the probability of producing a given isotope from fission or subsequent decay. They play an important role in nuclear energy development and particle physics research, and they can one day play a revolutionary role in nuclear monitoring and nonproliferation efforts worldwide. Traditional methods of determining FPYs are severely lacking, so we developed a novel measurement procedure. It was a success, but that success brought new challenges in analytics for data that did not previously exist. These challenges have required novel analytical approaches to better determine these crucial values, and we developed them. We have now achieved what may be the first measurement of FPYs for some of the biggest contributors to the reactor antineutrino anomaly, which may play a vital role in nuclear safety in the not so distant future.
