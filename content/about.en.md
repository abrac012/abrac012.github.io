description = "Hey there! I'm Aitor, and I'm a Physics PhD Candidate at Duke University. Currently, my research is focused on understanding antineutrino production at nuclear reactors. At large, I'm interested in research and policy development to decarbonize the US electric and transportation sectors."

My PhD research focuses on novel methods for determining the likelihood of producing various elements as a result of the fission process in nuclear reactors. Better understanding of these production probabilities (formally referred to as Fission Product Yields, or FPYs) has direct implications for nuclear nonproliferation efforts and reactor monitoring -- an increasingly important subject in the wake of rising demand for emissions-free energy.

Aside from my graduate school work, I recently interned with and now continue to volunteer for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters (NCLCV) on the development of North Carolina's renewable energy projects, primarily focusing on energy storage. At NCLCV I authored a critical assesement of Duke Energy's 2024 Integrated Resource Plan where I evaluated their proposals for energy storage development and emphasized the need for these to be larger and more ambitious projects than what is currently proposed. The report will be submitted as a statement of public comment to the North Carolina Public Utilities Commission for the upcoming Integrated Resource Plan cycle. 

As a researcher, beyond academia, I worked with the nuclear power development company TerraPower as part of their Molten Chloride Fast Reactor Experiment team. My work at TerraPower involved developing a model for reactor power fluctuations due to fuel circulation in their design. This was exciting work for me, as it gave me an opportunity to expand my knowledge of energy infrastructure development while adapting and growing my analytical skillset beyond the niche experimental physics applications of my graduate program.

I firmly believe in a decarbonized future where all people can have access to clean electricity, cleaner cities, and a variety of mobility and clean transportation options in those cities. To that end, I hope to continue to diversify and expand my expertise in the energy sector as well as dip my toes into the transportation sector! This website serves as a portfolio of my writing, analysis, and work towards the achievement of that future.
